This work is a completion of a text analytics module where we extract, refine and deliver insights of particular financial value that are extracted from unstructured data of non-conventional size from company reports. The data is collected from companies' financial statement filed at the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system used at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We first explored the principle of text mining to analyze structural elements of text, translation of insights, predicting stock price, identification of features (polarity, sentiment, topic modelling).
